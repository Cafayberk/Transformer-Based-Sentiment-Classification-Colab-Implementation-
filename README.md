## 🧠 Model Overview

The model uses the **`nn.TransformerEncoder`** architecture to classify text as **positive** or **negative**.  
A linear output layer with a sigmoid activation function is used for binary classification.

Model configuration:
- Embedding Dimension: **128**  
- Hidden Dimension: **64**  
- Number of Heads: **4**  
- Number of Layers: **2**  
- Output: **Binary (Positive / Negative)**  

Example model snippet:
```python
encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
    d_model=embedding_dim,
    nhead=num_heads,
    dim_feedforward=hidden_dim
)
self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)
```

## How to Run

Open Google Colab
.

Upload the notebook file:

sentiment_transformer.ipynb


Install the dependencies:

pip install torch numpy scikit-learn


Run all cells sequentially.

Observe the training progress, accuracy, and loss directly in Colab.

## Results

After training, the Transformer model learns to distinguish between positive and negative sentences.
Accuracy and loss graphs can be visualized during and after training.
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Transformer-based NLP models in a simple, educational setting.
